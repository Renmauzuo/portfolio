My name is Erik. I got started in software development many years ago with a Java class in high school. After that, I went to DePaul University where I graduated in 2009 with a degree in Computer Games Development. While at DePaul I worked with a variety of programming languages including C++, C#, AS3, and Python as well as platforms such as XNA, Unreal 3, and later Unity 3D.</p><p>I'm currently employed at a small company that makes software for assisted living communities. Prior to this I worked as a senior engineer at a healthcare advertising agency in Chicago. I started out by making native iOS apps in Objective C but these days my work is mostly node.js.</p><p>In my spare time I like to make mods and tools for some of my favorite games, all of which are open source and available to anyone who wants to use or modify them. Most of my portfolio, such as it is, can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Renmauzuo">Github</a> but you can find some of the highlights at the pages below:</p><ul><li><a href="everquest.html">Everquest Tools</a></li><li><a href="dungeons-and-dragons.html">Dungeons and Dragons Tools and Calculators</a></li><li><a href="mount-and-blade.html">Mount and Blade Mods</a></li></ul></section><footer><p>Feeling social?</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikspitzer/">LinkedIn</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Renmauzuo">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/erik.spitzer/">Facebook</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tanthiusvanter/">Instagram</a></p></footer></main></body></html>
