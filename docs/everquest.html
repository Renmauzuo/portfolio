Everquest is a game with hundreds of factions that have complex relationships with each other. Often making some factions like you more will damage your standing with others, but sometimes carefully choosing the methods you use to increase faction standings will allow you to work on some factons first, then repair others later. This is known as "faction dancing" in the community, and this was a tool I created to help determine the optimal path for factions that can be safely increased. It is missing many newer factions, and a few features I thought of after shelving it, but is populated enough to work for various older factions.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Renmauzuo/eqfactiondance">Github Repo</a></p><p><a href="https://renmauzuo.github.io/eqfactiondance/">Github Page</a></p></section><section><h2>Everquest Inventory Helper</h2><p>After more than two decades of expansions, Everquest has a <em>lot</em> of different items. I found that after a big hunting session I often had to look up many of the items in my bags to determine what was worth keeping and what was just junk to sell. Eventually I started keeping track of items in a spreadsheet to avoid constantly looking up the same items when I forgot what was useful, but even that was still a bit tedious, so I made this tool to automate the process.</p><p>Users can upload their inventory output file along with a spreadsheet they've created based on my template that outlines what items they care about. The tool will then tell them what to do with the items in their inventory.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Renmauzuo/everquest-inventory-helper">Github Repo</a></p><p><a href="https://renmauzuo.github.io/everquest-inventory-helper/">Github Page</a></p></section><footer><p>Feeling social?</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikspitzer/">LinkedIn</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Renmauzuo">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/erik.spitzer/">Facebook</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tanthiusvanter/">Instagram</a></p></footer></main></body></html>
